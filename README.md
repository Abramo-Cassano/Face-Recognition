# Face-Verification - Using Seimese Network

In this project I perform a simple Deep learning network base on [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Siamese-Neural-Networks-for-One-Shot-Image-Koch/f216444d4f2959b4520c61d20003fa30a199670a)

This project will identify a person based on the given images
### Dataset: 
- My personale images as input and training images: 600 images (250x250px)
- [Labelled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/): For noise and classification

### Result
The result Caculated by Recall and Precision\
